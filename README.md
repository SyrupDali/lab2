## Description
### Challenge
Recommendation is a core task in data mining particularly well suited for making decisions based on an overwhelming amount past decisions, typically made by other people. Typical examples are the buying recommendations at large web shops, or what music to listen to.

In this bonus assignment, you will work with a dataset provided by Breeze, which is a dating app. You will have to develop an algorithm that, based on the data, predicts as accurately as possible if a person would like another person, based on their previous ratings.

Feel free to use a distance-based method, a factorisation-based method, or a combination. You are not allowed to use scikit-learn (or any other machine learning) libraries for your submission. Your solution has to run your own code for making its predictions.

### Additional
This was an assignment from Data Mining course. The faculty posted the assignment as a Kaggle Competition to evaluate the algorithm we implemented.
